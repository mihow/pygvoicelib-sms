-- pygovoicelib v1.0 --

This is the TELTUB release of a library to use Google Voice API.
The library uses ClientLogin mechanism and supports Captcha locks on the account as well as session saving.

QUICK OVERVIEW
--------------
The main file that you will need is:
* pygovoicelib.py

All the functions are documented inside the code. For a quick documentation, just do:
>python
>>> import pygovoicelib
>>> help(pygovoicelib)

They have full text that guides you through and very simple source. Please refer to them as an example of proper usage of the library.

INSTALLATION
--------------
The library is just a standalone file, and a JSON library if your python is 2.4 or below.
    pygvoicelib.py

To add it to your python environment, copy it to your python library directory, or put it in the current directory.
For example, in python 2.4, on RHEL5, the directory is: /usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/

As for JSON library:
    For python 2.4, I have placed simplejson and a json.py that is just a compatibility wrapper for simplejson to be usable just like the json library under python 2.5+.

    For python 2.5+, you can simple remove json.py (and simplejson) and it should work okey.
